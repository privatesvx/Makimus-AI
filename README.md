## ⚙️ Requirements

- Python 3.10, 3.11, or 3.12
- NVIDIA GPU (recommended) — or AMD GPU with DirectML on Windows
- CPU mode works but is much slower
- Windows / Linux / macOS

---

## 🐍 Installing Python

If you don't have Python installed, follow the steps for your operating system.

### Windows
1. Go to [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download Python **3.11** (recommended)
2. Run the installer — **check "Add Python to PATH"** before clicking Install
3. Open a terminal and verify: `python --version`

### macOS
```bash
# Using Homebrew (recommended):
brew install python@3.11

# Or download the installer from python.org/downloads
```

### Linux (Ubuntu / Debian / Kubuntu)
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-venv python3-tk
```

> **Verify your install:** `python3 --version` — should show 3.10, 3.11, or 3.12.

---

## 🚀 Installation

### Windows — Easy Install

**1. Clone the repo:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ubaida-M-Yusuf/Makimus-AI.git
cd Makimus-AI
```

**2.** Double-click **`Install.bat`** — it creates a virtual environment, installs all dependencies, and launches the app automatically.

Use **`Run.bat`** every time you want to start the app after that.

> **Note:** `Install.bat` installs CUDA 12.8 PyTorch and is intended for NVIDIA GPU users. AMD or CPU-only users should follow the manual installation steps below.

---

### Manual Installation

**1. Clone the repo:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ubaida-M-Yusuf/Makimus-AI.git
cd Makimus-AI
```

**2. Linux only — install system dependencies:**
```bash
sudo apt install python3-tk python3-pip libgl1 libglib2.0-0 ffmpeg
```
> This step is required on Linux. `libgl1` and `libglib2.0-0` are needed by OpenCV, `ffmpeg` is needed for video support, and `python3-tk` is needed for the GUI. Skip this step on Windows and macOS.

**3. Create a virtual environment:**
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

**4. Activate the virtual environment:**

**Windows (Git Bash):**
```bash
source venv/Scripts/activate
```

**Windows (Command Prompt):**
```bat
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**Mac / Linux:**
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

**5. Install dependencies — pick the right command for your GPU:**

**NVIDIA GPU — All modern cards (RTX 20xx, 30xx, 40xx, 50xx):**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> **Older NVIDIA GPUs (GTX 900 series and earlier):** If installation fails or CUDA is not detected, try CUDA 12.6 instead:
> ```bash
> pip install Pillow==12.0.0 numpy==2.2.6 open_clip_torch==3.2.0 rawpy==0.26.1 opencv-python==4.13.0.92 Send2Trash==2.1.0 tkinterdnd2
> pip install torch==2.9.1+cu126 torchvision==0.24.1+cu126 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126
> ```

**Apple Silicon (MPS) — GPU acceleration built in, no extras needed:**
```bash
pip install Pillow==12.0.0 numpy==2.2.6 open_clip_torch==3.2.0 rawpy==0.26.1 opencv-python==4.13.0.92 Send2Trash==2.1.0 tkinterdnd2
pip install torch==2.10.0 torchvision==0.25.0
```

**No NVIDIA GPU / CPU only:**
```bash
pip install Pillow==12.0.0 numpy==2.2.6 open_clip_torch==3.2.0 rawpy==0.26.1 opencv-python==4.13.0.92 Send2Trash==2.1.0 tkinterdnd2
pip install torch==2.10.0 torchvision==0.25.0
```

**AMD GPU — Windows (DirectML):**
```bash
pip install Pillow==12.0.0 numpy==2.2.6 open_clip_torch==3.2.0 rawpy==0.26.1 opencv-python==4.13.0.92 Send2Trash==2.1.0 tkinterdnd2
pip install torch==2.10.0 torchvision==0.25.0
pip install torch-directml
```

**AMD GPU — Linux (ROCm):**

ROCm requires a separate PyTorch build and is not officially supported. If you want to try it, visit [pytorch.org](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally) and select ROCm as the compute platform. Note that only RX 6000 and RX 7000 series GPUs are well supported. If ROCm setup fails the app will fall back to CPU automatically.

**Optional (legacy): ONNX acceleration**

Only useful on older NVIDIA GPUs. **Requires code changes inside `Makimus-AI.py` to enable — not plug and play.**
```bash
pip install onnxruntime-gpu==1.23.2
```

---

## ▶️ Run
```bash
# Make sure your venv is active, then:
python Makimus-AI.py
```

Windows users can double-click **`Run.bat`**.

---

## 🔄 Updating
```bash
# Pull latest code
git pull
```

Then update dependencies. **Important: uninstall PyTorch first** — pip will not correctly switch CUDA versions without this step:
```bash
pip uninstall torch torchvision -y
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> Your existing cache files are fully compatible — no re-indexing needed after an update.

## 📖 How to Use

### First Launch
1. Launch the app — on **first run it will automatically download the AI model (~1.7 GB)** from HuggingFace. This only happens once and is cached locally.
2. Click **Folder** and select the folder containing your images and/or videos.
3. If no index exists for that folder, a popup will ask if you want to index it — click **Yes** to start. To index videos separately, use the **Index Videos** button.
4. Indexing runs in the background with a progress bar. You can start searching before it finishes.

### Searching
- **Text search:** Just type what you're looking for and hit Enter or click Search. You don't need exact filenames — describe the content. *"sunset over ocean"*, *"person in blue jacket"*, *"fight scene"* all work.
  - **Negative terms:** Put a minus sign before any word to exclude it — *"cat -dog"* finds cats without dogs in the image. Lower the Similarity Score to 0.10 or below when using negative terms for the best results.
- **Image search:** Click the **Image** button and pick any image from your computer, or just **drag and drop an image directly onto the app** — Makimus will find everything in your collection that looks visually similar. Works for both images and video frames.
- The **Similarity Score** slider controls how strict the matching is. Lower it to get more results, raise it to get only close matches.

### Working with Results
- **Single click** → opens the file's location in Explorer / Finder / Dolphin
- **Double click** → opens the file in your default viewer or player
- **Right-click** → context menu with open, show in folder, copy, move, delete, select/deselect
- **Click and drag** on empty space in the results area → rubber-band select multiple files at once
- Use the **Images / Videos** toggle buttons to show only what you want

### Video Search
- Video results show a thumbnail of the matching frame with a timestamp (e.g. `t=1:23`)
- **Best Frame mode** — disabled by default. When enabled, the app finds and displays the single best-matching frame from across the entire video rather than the nearest sampled frame. Useful when you want one clean representative result per video. Enable it using the toggle in the interface.
- Double-clicking a video result opens it in your default player

### File Operations
- Select files using right-click or rubber-band drag, then hit **Export** to copy them somewhere or **Move** to relocate them. Your selection stays active after the operation so you can copy to one place and move to another without reselecting.
- **Delete to Recycle Bin** — right-click any result and delete it safely. Goes to your Recycle Bin so you can recover it if needed.

### Managing Your Index
- **Refresh** — added new files to your folder? Just hit Refresh. It scans for changes and only processes what's new or removed — no need to re-index everything from scratch.
- The cache file lives inside your media folder and loads automatically next time you open that folder. You can rename or move the folder and the cache still works — it uses relative paths internally.
- Cache management is fully automatic. The app won't overwrite a good cache with a partial one.

## 🧠 Model

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Model | ViT-L-14 |
| Pretrained on | laion2b_s32b_b82k |
| Library | open_clip_torch |
| Download size | ~1.7 GB (automatic on first run, cached locally) |

**Why ViT-L-14 on LAION-2B?**


ViT-L-14 is one of the largest and most capable open CLIP models available. It was trained on LAION-2B — a dataset of 2 billion image-text pairs scraped from the real internet, completely uncurated and unfiltered. This matters because most commercial models are trained on carefully filtered datasets that exclude large categories of content.
Because LAION-2B reflects what actually exists on the internet, the model understands an extremely wide range of visual content: photography, illustrations, anime, art styles, adult content, niche genres, and everything in between. It handles abstract descriptions just as well as specific visual details.
This makes it significantly more versatile for diverse personal media collections compared to models trained on sanitized or domain-specific datasets — which is exactly what Makimus-AI is designed for.

## 📝 Notes

- The model downloads automatically on first launch (~1.7 GB) — this only happens once
- Cache files are stored inside your media folder — keep them for instant future searches
- After adding new files, use **Refresh** to update the index
- Renaming or moving the indexed folder does not break the cache
- CPU-only mode works but indexing will be significantly slower
- After indexing, if any files failed to process, Makimus creates `makimus_skipped_images.txt` and/or `makimus_skipped_videos.txt` inside your indexed folder. Each run appends to the file with a timestamp and the list of failed files — useful for identifying corrupt or unreadable files in your collection
- Indexing speed depends on your hardware. SSDs are faster overall, but the real bottleneck is your GPU — a powerful GPU will outpace any drive. HDDs work fine but are slower, especially for large collections
